# sandsketch
Lets you use a PS5 DualSense controller and a PC to turn your sandtable into an etch-a-sketch, with a few extra controls for inituitive arcs, circles and spirals. Can also home the table and has a built-in screen wipe for all or part of the table. You can save your drawing as gcode to replay in the future.

The program's welcome message:

    Welcome to SandSketch!
    SandSketch requires a PC and a PlayStation 5 DualSense controller.
    You should be facing the long side of your table so Y=0 is to your right, and max Y to your left.
    
    Use left and right joysticks like an etch-a-sketch.
    
    To draw arcs, circles, or spirals, press the circle button to set the center point, then move a distance away which will set the radius.
    
    Press and hold the left joystick to draw a counterclockwise arc or circle.
    Press and hold the right joystick to draw a clockwise arc or circle.
    
    You can then move further away from the center point to draw concentric circles.
    Press the R1 or L1 buttons to draw tight spirals.
    Press the R2 or L2 buttons to draw loose spirals.
    
    Press the options button (the one with the three horizontal lines) to home the table.
    
    Press the create button (the one with the three flared lines) to wipe the table.
    By default it will wipe the entire table, which will take a while.
    You can also set a smaller the wipe area by pressing the right D-pad button to set the right edge to wipe to and the left D-pad button at the furthest left you'd like to start.
    Home and Wipe commands are not saved to the gcode file.
